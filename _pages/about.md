Greetings! My name is Yee Man Choi (you are also welcome to call me Kath). I am an PhD Student at the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo. I am fortunate to be co-supervised by Professors [Freda Shi](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fhs/) and [Krzysztof Czarnecki](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/profile/k2czarne). I completed my M.S. degrees at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), where I was advised by Professor [Lei Li](https://lileicc.github.io/). Prior to that, I received my BASc of Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto, St. George Campus, with a minor in Artificial Intelligence. 

My research interests lie broadly in natural language processing, with a particular emphasis on LLM alignment, reliability, and safety. I am interested in understanding and evaluating large language models, including their behaviors, failure modes, limitations and risks. I aim to contribute to research that advances language models not only in terms of performance, but also in trustworthiness and responsible deployment.
